*July 10â€“11*

This is [the signup form](https://cloud.pik-potsdam.de/index.php/apps/forms/s/sZQErTQcQcWBxZRNKbWtdfMJ) for the first DEST hackathon in [Potsdam on the Telegrafenberg](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/contact/where). The event is organised by the [Evidence for Climate Solutions](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/departments/climate-economics-and-policy/research/evidence-for-climate-solutions) group at PIK as part of the [Wellcome-funded DESTinY project](https://destiny-evidence.github.io/website/).    

Everyone who is interested in AI for digital evidence synthesis / technology assisted reviews (text mining to summarise findings published in research articles) is warmly welcome! The main themes for the workshop will be user interfaces and evaluation of AI-assisted methods to automate (parts of) the synthesis pipeline. 

Example projects could be to compile a list of existing (interactive) platforms to share syntheses and to collect useful features that we should be able to replicate. At the same time, we might also want to test some of our early demonstrator products to measure real-world benefits over conventional approaches.

This is not just for people with programming skills; anyone is needed and warmly welcome. Some experience in evidence synthesis (meta-studies, systematic maps, systematic reviews) is helpful. Data scientists get the opportunity to work with large human-annotated datasets to evaluate their tools or experiment with ideas such as preparing (semi-)supervised fine-tuning data for domain-specific LLMs. 

The hackathon is co-hosted with the DESTinY or ICASR meeting. If you already indicated your hackathon participation there, you don't need to sign up here too.
