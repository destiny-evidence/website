We would like to invite you to an
ICASR [(International Collaboration for the Automation of Systematic Reviews)](https://icasr.github.io/)
meeting about automation methods for reference screening in systematic reviews, hosted by the DESTInY Consortium. The
event will be hybrid in-person/virtual and conducted across two days.
The in-person day will be at [PIK Potsdam on the Telegrafenberg](https://www.pik-potsdam.de/en/institute/contact/where)
(Potsdam Institute for Climate Impacts Research, Germany), one day before the DEST-Hackathon on 10th–11th July.

We will explore both published research and practical insights on how to apply stopping rules in reference screening and
the current state of research on this topic. During the hackathon we will continue discussions and work on developing
and evaluating the safety of stopping rules.

Whether you're a researcher, data scientist, or otherwise interested in literature reviews, these sessions will cover
the following:

* A critical discussion on robustness and associated risks, including tips on how to evaluate them fairly.
* Insights into collaborative work completed during hackathons such as the EvidenceSynthesisHackathon and
  DEST-Hackathon.

## Agenda
